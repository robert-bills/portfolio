# About Rob Bills

I’m Rob, a database engineer, logistician, developer educator, and former Air Force instructor who believes great learning starts with respect, not requirements.  I've come to believe that effective learning is just as much an emotional activity as intellectual.  I believe in creating an environment to support this.

For over 20 years, I’ve taught everyone from cybersecurity pros to absolute beginners. My career has taken me from teaching military technologies to onboarding software engineers at top-tier cybersecurity companies. Now I'm building my own educational platforms from the ground up.

## 💡 My Approach

I create technical learning experiences that make people say, “Oh, I *get* it now.”

That means:
- Breaking down intimidating topics without dumbing them down
- Respecting learners’ time, emotions, and starting point
- Using clarity, empathy, and a dash of humor to connect

I design content for real-world delivery—printable worksheets, SCORM-ready modules, video scripts, facilitator guides, and full-stack documentation.

## 🧰 Skills That Bridge the Gap

I live in the overlap of:

- **Instructional Design** – Military-trained curriculum builder using proven ISD models
- **Developer Enablement** – Sample code, onboarding flows, DevRel content, API walkthroughs
- **Security Awareness** – Non-jargony, human-centered content for broad audiences
- **Automation & Tools** – Python, PowerShell, GitHub automation, course data pipelines
- **Creative Production** – Voiceovers, podcast scripting, branded educational storytelling

## 🎯 My Mission

I’ve seen too many smart people discouraged out of tech because they were told they didn’t have “the mind for it.”

I’m here to build the programs, tools, and pathways that prove otherwise.

Through DeveloperYou School, SeaBeasties Tools, and client work, I focus on:
- Creating learning that’s *possible* on a $50 Chromebook
- Designing for time-constrained, neurodiverse, and underserved learners
- Helping teams and orgs deliver content that actually teaches
